This project is currently little more than an update of  [DavidChouinard's congressviz](https://github.com/DavidChouinard/congressviz) using GovPredict data. The interactive visualization uses [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and the graph files were generated using the [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) Python package.
